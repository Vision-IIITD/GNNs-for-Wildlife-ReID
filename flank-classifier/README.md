# flank-classifier

This directory contains a notebook for training a simple binary flank classification model using a ResNet-18 backbone. The model is trained on WII ReID dataset and is used to classify tiger images as either belonging to their left or right flanks.

A pre-trained classifier model is providied as `tiger_flank_classifier.pt`. The notebook `flank_classifier.ipynb` can be used to train the model from scratch.
